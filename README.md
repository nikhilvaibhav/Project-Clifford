# Project-Clifford

I tried creating this Desktop assistant AI using Python's text to speech library called pyttsx3. I added few functions for text to speech, take commands, wish me etc to.
Take command takes command in the form of query and then performs the task. Currently it accepts few commands like opening notepad, Vs code, playimg songs on youtube.
More functionalities will be added in the coming days.
